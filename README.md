# mlspringbootdemo

Simple search application using spring boot, Thymeleaf template engine and MarkLogic java client api
The application java code is at some places inspired from legacy top song java application
https://github.com/MarkLogicUniversity/top-songs/tree/master/java/TopSongs

Note : bootRun Gradle command will create Marklogic instance and deploy the top-song database and its content before deploying
the web application to tomcat.
